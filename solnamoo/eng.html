This job is eating me alive

 
The man in the white hat. 


I’m not becoming like them.


Ten of me are doing the best speech from DONNIE BRASCO.


Get it together man.


So the store was hit about two hours ago.


Whoever access to store.


His parents didn’t give him enough attention.



One of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.


Fuzzy cuddle bear.



He’s a nanny cam.



And figured that in this gigantic electronics store,


There had to be at least one working camera.



You did it, fuzzy.
You busted ‘EM.


I’ve been undercover so long, t’ve forgotten who I am.


I haven’t known the touch if a woman in many moons.


Yes, I did check the case.


Would you do the honors?


(Sighs)


Enjoy it while it lasts.


JP, update the MORGENTHAU murder?


Luxury food importer HENRY MORGENTHAU.


Body was found by the cleaning lady.


During her interview, I deduced, using expert detective work.


That she had something super gross on her chin.


(All groaning)


I think it was flan.


I thinks it was BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING.


Maybe it was just old person gunk.


Crime ticks are at the scene now.


We’re heading back when they’re done.


I want you on this .


It’s gonna be priority one for the new C.O.


You know any scalpers?


She’s got a type.


Which is really anyone but you.



Look, a RIHANNA concert’s a pretty big swing, man.


And search for the phrase



I just wish captain	MCGINTLEY never left, he was the best.


You just liked him ‘cause he let you do anything you want it.



Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?


If I;m ever gonna make captain, I need a good mentor.


Sorry, dude. 


But this new guy’s gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who’s only concerned with…(robotically)
In the patrol guide.


Is that what you think?


New captain alert.


Now don’w let me interrupt	. 


You were describing what kind of person I’m gonna be.


I’d like you to finish.


That’s not necessary.


Or I could recap very quickly, sure.


I think I say some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher.


When you implied I’m a rule-following robot.


He cares that you follow his direct orders.


He’s so suave.


Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe?


Sergeant	, you were t-in the 1-8 with me…though you were significantly—fatter,  sir


They called me “TERRY TITTIES”


Though to be fair, it was accurate.


What’s this I hear about you being on administrative leave?


They have adorable chubby cheeks.


Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt.


Lost may edge. 

There was an incident in a department store. 


You look a little jumpy.


They’re pretty much workless.

Tell me who has me for secret Santa.


That takes all the fun out of it.


I’ll make him return it.



He’s grander.
